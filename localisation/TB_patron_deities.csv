patron_tyr;Tyrran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
patron_tyr_desc;Tyr is the deity of law and justice and part of the group of deities known as the Triad. He appeared as an one-handed warrior and, after the Time of Troubles, blind as well. Tyr was strong-spirited and noble and saw himself as a fatherly figure trying to create an utopian society on Toril. To outsiders, however, he often seems like a stern and harsh punisher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.1;In order to emulate your patron deity, you decide to cut off one of your own hands. This is quite clearly a decision from which there is no turning back, but you go through with it anyway. With a quick chop of a blade, your hand is separated from the wrist in a bloody and painful mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.1a;I'm- argh! ... closer to the Even-Handed now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_maim_self;Maim Yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_maim_self_desc;To truly prove your devotion, you could remove one of your own hands in order to emulate your god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.2;In order to emulate your patron deity, you decide to blind yourself. While this is an extreme measure, the Even-Handed himself is blind and you feel like you must live up to his own example. And thus, you lift the soon-to-be-bloody blade up to your eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.2a;Justice is... ungh... blind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_blind_self;Blind Yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_maim_self_desc;To truly prove your devotion, you could blind yourself in order to emulate your god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_confess;Confess your failings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_confess_desc;Tyrran doctrine encourages the faithful to confess their failings regularly to a member of the god's clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.3;Part of being a Tyrran is to regularly confess your failings to the church, so that you may be judged in the eyes of your god. And thus you do so, receiving absolution, or admonishment should the situation demand it, for your acts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.3a;It feels good to confess from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.3b;If anything, I should be judging them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_confessed;Confessed recently;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.5;[FROM.GetBestName] has approached you with a request. [FROM.GetSheHe] seems to have doubts of a legal nature and, given that you are one of Tyr's faithful, has decided to ask you about them. You consider your answer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.5a;Give [FROM.GetHerHim] the advice [FROM.GetSheHe] seeks as best you can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.5b;Refuse to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_good_advice;Gave good advice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bad_advice;Gave bad advice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.6;[FROM.GetBestName] has returned to you and thanked you for the legal advise you gave [FROM.GetHerHim] earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.6a;It was my pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.7;[FROM.GetBestName] has returned to you is not happy at all! Turns out the legal advice you gave [FROM.GetHerHim] was wrong and ended up causing [FROM.GetHerHim] quite a bit of grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.7a;Whoops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_innumerable_edicts;Read the Innumerable Edicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.8;As part of your faith, you are required to read the Innumerable Edicts, a compilation of all laws and regulations of the Tyrran Church. The text, however, is incredibly dry and dense and you feel as though you won't be able to force yourself to finish it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.8a;I must persist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.8b;I'd rather be doing something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_refused_lawyering;Refused to act as lawyer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_good_lawyering;Good lawyering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bad_lawyering;Bad lawyering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_pro_bono;Acted as lawyer for free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.10;[FROM.GetBestName] is, it appears, in legal trouble. So much so that [FROM.GetSheHe] requires your help as a lawyer, since that is a duty that Tyrrans often fulfill. This is not something you can accept without consideration, however, since [FROM.GetBestName]'s future would be in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.10a;I'll do it, but I'll require payment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.10b;I'll do it for free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.10c;Sorry, but I can't do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.11;You acted as a lawyer for [FROM.GetBestName] in the legal case [FROM.GetSheHe] was in and managed to successfully argue [FROM.GetHerHis] case before the court. As agreed, a grateful [FROM.GetBestName] gives you your pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.11a;Keep the money for yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.11b;Donate the money to the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.12;You acted as a lawyer for [FROM.GetBestName] in the legal case [FROM.GetSheHe] was in and managed to successfully argue [FROM.GetHerHis] case before the court. Afterwards, a grateful [FROM.GetBestName] thanks you for your service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.12a;Justice is served.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.13;You acted as a lawyer for [FROM.GetBestName] in the legal case [FROM.GetSheHe] was in and performed rather poorly. Not surprisingly, [FROM.GetBestName] is not at all pleased with you at the moment, and that doesn't seem like it will change soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.13a;Maybe I should leave it to the professionals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_refused_law_change;Unjust ruler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_accepted_law_change;Just ruler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.15;[FROM.GetBestName] approaches you while at court to bring a legal matter to your attention. According to the Tyrran, it appears that one of the laws in your realm contradicts others, and is thus unjust. [FROM.GetSheHe] petitions you to change or revoke that law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.15a;Change the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.15b;I rule here, not you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.17;You've noticed that over the course of several of Tyr's monthly High Rites, you and [FROM.GetBestName] have grown closer to each other. In fact, it can be said that through your shared faith, you've become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.17a;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_call_tyr_knights;Call for Tyr's Knights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_call_tyr_knights_desc;Ask the Church of Tyr to send holy knights to aid you in your war against a servant of one of Tyr's own enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
patron_selune;Selûnite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
patron_selune_desc;Selûne is one of the oldest deities on Toril and is the goddess of the moon, stars, navigation, wanderers and non-evil lycanthropes. She is the eternal enemy of her sister Shar and the phases of the moon reflect this conflict. The highest principle amongst Selûnites is that of tolerance, followed by equality, acceptance and understanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
