patron_tyr_desc;Tyr is the deity of law and justice and part of the group of deities known as the Triad. He appeared as an one-handed warrior and, after the Time of Troubles, blind as well. Tyr was strong-spirited and noble and saw himself as a fatherly figure trying to create an utopian society on Toril. To outsiders, however, he often seems like a stern and harsh punisher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With a quick chop of a blade, your hand is separated from the wrist in a bloody and painful mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TYREVT.2;In order to emulate your patron deity, you decide to blind yourself. While this is an extreme measure, the Even-Handed himself is blind and you feel like you must live up to his own example. And thus, you lift the soon-to-be-bloody blade up to your eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.2a;Justice is... ungh... blind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
