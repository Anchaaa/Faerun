patron_tyr;Tyrran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
patron_tyr_desc;Tyr is the deity of law and justice and part of the group of deities known as the Triad. He appeared as an one-handed warrior and, after the Time of Troubles, blind as well. Tyr was strong-spirited and noble and saw himself as a fatherly figure trying to create an utopian society on Toril. To outsiders, however, he often seems like a stern and harsh punisher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.1;In order to emulate your patron deity, you decide to cut off one of your own hands. This is quite clearly a decision from which there is no turning back, but you go through with it anyway. With a quick chop of a blade, your hand is separated from the wrist in a bloody and painful mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.1a;I'm- argh! ... closer to the Even-Handed now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_maim_self;Maim Yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_maim_self_desc;To truly prove your devotion, you could remove one of your own hands in order to emulate your god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.2;In order to emulate your patron deity, you decide to blind yourself. While this is an extreme measure, the Even-Handed himself is blind and you feel like you must live up to his own example. And thus, you lift the soon-to-be-bloody blade up to your eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.2a;Justice is... ungh... blind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_blind_self;Blind Yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_maim_self_desc;To truly prove your devotion, you could blind yourself in order to emulate your god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_confess;Confess your failings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_confess_desc;Tyrran doctrine encourages the faithful to confess their failings regularly to a member of the god's clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.3;Part of being a Tyrran is to regularly confess your failings to the church, so that you may be judged in the eyes of your god. And thus you do so, receiving absolution, or admonishment should the situation demand it, for your acts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.3a;It feels good to confess from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.3b;If anything, I should be judging them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_confessed;Confessed recently;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.5;[FROM.GetBestName] has approached you with a request. [FROM.GetSheHe] seems to have doubts of a legal nature and, given that you are one of Tyr's faithful, has decided to ask you about them. You consider your answer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.5a;Give [FROM.GetHerHim] the advice [FROM.GetSheHe] seeks as best you can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.5b;Refuse to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_good_advice;Gave good advice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bad_advice;Gave bad advice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.6;[FROM.GetBestName] has returned to you and thanked you for the legal advise you gave [FROM.GetHerHim] earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.6a;It was my pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.7;[FROM.GetBestName] has returned to you is not happy at all! Turns out the legal advice you gave [FROM.GetHerHim] was wrong and ended up causing [FROM.GetHerHim] quite a bit of grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.7a;Whoops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tyr_innumerable_edicts;Read the Innumerable Edicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.8;As part of your faith, you are required to read the Innumerable Edicts, a compilation of all laws and regulations of the Tyrran Church. The text, however, is incredibly dry and dense and you feel as though you won't be able to force yourself to finish it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.8a;I must persist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TYREVT.8b;I'd rather be doing something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
