elder_concord_desc;The Elder Concord is a ruling body in illithid society. Each Concord in the society is tasked with rulership responsibilities, however, the society's elder brain can propose its own plans and even decide the action taken by the Elder Concord, should they be undecided. Elder Concords were responsible for electing officials in illithid community, such as quastors (finance and trade officials), vigileators (security officials), and aedileators (general officials).;;;;;;;;;;;x

#annoy illithid in other societies
