EVTNAME_ALWAR_4;Harbingers of Conflict;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_0;The rule of [target_ruler.GetTitledName] is notorious, and in all the lands around, adventurers and heralds are on the road, gathering to the banners of those who stand against this menace.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_1;A small band of troubled preachers came to your court today. Wild-eyed, they proclaimed that the judgment of the heavens would imminently be proclaimed against a realm of notorious sinners. The wise folk of your court tried to question the travellers, but they would not be detained, and vanished altogether before dusk.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_1_SHOU;A great omen has been reported! After many human generations of absence, the fabled Chu Jen Yin have been seen from the walls of the imperial capital, Kuo Te' Lung. In the past, these elusive Giants in Grey have heralded the splitting of the empire, or the destruction of a whole kingdom. What they now portend, only time will tell...;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_2;A thunderstorm rolls in unexpectedly, whose clouds are red with fire as often as they are white with lightning. A cold wind blows, and small animals are found suddenly dead. Surely this portends the arrival of some unclean being of great power...;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_3;At dawn, the sky remains dark. A scent of brimstone hangs in the air, and cats and dogs hide under tables. When the sun finally appears at noon, a sickly-faced messenger comes to tell you that temple doors across the land have been daubed or branded with a symbol like an eye with three cruciform arms. Such an omen heralds the powers of the Hells.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_4;At breakfast, a courtier mentions to you that a merchant had his shipment detained by orcs in military uniform last tenday. This is the third such report you've heard, but this one adds a striking detail: when they had completed their inspection, the orcs departed in a flying ship!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_5;From across the Southern Ocean, traders come in small ships, reporting that every trade route to the Celestial Sea is disrupted by the presence of a vast invasion fleet slowly heaed westward. It has been many a long year since such a force sailed west from any port in Kara-Tur...;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_4_6;Where do so many oni come from? Some say they spring out of the rocks, others that they lurk in the Feywild and the Shadowfell, or dwell with the gods on the Outlands. But wherever they live when the heavens are at peace, now they are on the move, roaming across the lands of Kara-Tur in response to a distant war-drum.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ALWAR_4;What's going to happen next?;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ALWAR_10;Our realm is facing a truly dangerous, unprecedented conflict. In these dire circumstances, it wouldn't be unreasonable to ask for help far and wide, and to stop any of our other current wars.;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ALWAR_11;To arms!;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ALWAR_11;I've got other things to worry about.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ALWAR_12;To the respectable [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nOur realm is under attack by dangerous invaders, led by [invader_char.GetTitledName].

EVTOPTA_ALWAR_12;Of course.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ALWAR_12;Ha! I'll fight you and anyone who dares to interfere.;;;;;;;;x
