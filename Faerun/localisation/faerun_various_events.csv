WAR_HELP_OFFERS.4.desc;As war rages, some in your court have recommended arming a force of slaves. They won't be the best fighters, but it would be a quick way to amass fresh bodies for the slaughter.;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Magic Apprentice###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FMU_0002;Your apprentice has shown the basics of magical training, learning enough not to kill themselves, hopefully. But there's many professions in the magical world, and setting them down this path will likely lose them for decades, if not centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FMU_0002;No! Immortality and power is mine alone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FMU_0002;From lonely tree, to mountain tops, we defend.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FMU_0002;Knowlegdge is power, strength of will to wield it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Robber Baron###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FRE_0001;My lord, it would seem your robber knights have elected amongst themselves a Baron, and now this warrior has come to your court seeking employment under your banner. What shall we do with this ruffian?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FRE_0001;I have just the job in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FRE_0001;A jumped up bandit? Call for my guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Reigned too long###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FCE_0001;I have reigned for long enough that my rulership is starting to be taken for granted. Some of my vassals have come to chafe at the lack of advancement opportunities in the realm and will likely make trouble if they remain in power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0001;Worrying to have such conspirators amongst the vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0001;My most loyal subject, perish these thoughts of sedition and discourse...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FCE_0001;Have you forgotten why I have ruled this long?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FCE_0001;Vile snake, you question my authority?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_FCE_0001;You know what, I'm tired, and you're right. Farewell, I'm leaving.;;;;;;;;;;;x
placeholdername_44;My scheming vassals, certain that they will never get to taste real power under my rule, are definitely plotting my demise. For the sake of my long reign they must be stamped out, root and branch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Republic Ruler Reigned too long###
EVTDESC_FCE_0011;[long_reigning_doge.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled for so many years, it has become hard to remember a time when [long_reigning_doge.GetSheHe] wasn't in charge. Some people are starting to think of [long_reigning_doge.GetHerHim] as more of a feudal overlord than as a leader of a republic. Perhaps it's time to do something about that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0011;Time to finance some naysayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0011;I'll convince everyone that a change at the top is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FCE_0011;I know how to spread malicious rumors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FCE_0011;Nonsense, I'm a loyal vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FCE_0012;Many of your vassals and courtiers are unhappy with your long reign at the helm of our republic. There are even rumors that you're planning to turn our nation into a full-blown feudal monarchy...many are asking that you step down, for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0012;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0012;I AM the republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Realm Decisions###;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#COURT MAGE OPTIONS
EVTDESC_FMU_0013_WITCH;Your rangers report a suspected witch living in the outskirts of the realm. She is known for practicing sorcery, and the local villagers do not trust her. She is willing to put her spellcasting expertise to good use in your court and offers to become your court mage in exchange for naught but a small vial of your blood. A most strange offer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FMU_0013;A small vial of my blood? I see nothing wrong with that!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FMU_0013_TIEFLING;A wanderer comes to your court, hiding their features in a deep cowled hood. A faint smell of brimstone pervades the room as they extend an offer to become your court mage. All they seek is the security and hospitality of your court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FMU_0013;This sounds like someone I can trust.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BEHOLDERPREG.1;Today you awoke to find a swelling beneath your tongue. Dipping into your racial memories, you know what this means: you are pregnant. You must gorge yourself with as much food as you can, for this swelling will soon block your entire maw.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.1a;My rivals will seek to exploit this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.2;The time has come. The swollen egg-womb filling your mouth is now ready to hatch. You unhinge your jaw and spit it out, biting off the tissue connecting it to you. From the bloody mess emerge several tiny beholders. You can stand only one of the wretches, so one will be picked and the rest driven off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.2a;You. You look the most like me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1;As you sleep, your dreams take an unsual turn and you dream of a beholder, quite like yourself but not quite as perfect as you are. When you wake up, you are surprised to see that very same beholder has appeared before you. They seem somewhat disoriented, but appear to recognize your superiority. For now, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1a;I suppose I can take you under my tutelage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1b;Away, foul impostor!;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.2;Lately your dreams have been taking you to dark places, and this one is perhaps the greatest example of this. You dream that you die, and yet remain alive somehow. Beyond death. When you awake, you find that during your sleep your flesh and organs have sloughed off and you are now undead - a death tyrant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.2a;Not even death can stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ABOLETHEGG.1;The wait is finally over. The egg you laid five years ago has finally hatched and a spawn slithers forth, ready to join you in your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ABOLETHEGG.1a;Come, spawnling, there is much to do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
USURPER_HOST;Usurper Host;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRDOF.2;Terrible news - [From.GetBestName] has amassed a host of warriors who [From.GetSheHe] has convinced that you are weak unfit to rule! Now they assemble on our borders and march on your lands. Only war will dissuade them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRDOF.2a;The gods will see I am worthy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.19;Despite its significance, Midwinter Night's celebrations take very little organizing. The holy day consists of an entire night's worth of dancing on ice to both exalt [Root.AurilLoc] herself as well as to attract new worshippers to her service. It is an uncharacteristic enjoyable celebration for a harsh goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.19a;A beautiful night for a dance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
auril_midwinter_mod;Celebrated Midwinter;;;;;;;;;;;x
embraced_by_auril;Embraced by [Root.AurilLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.20;As you ready yourself to undergo the Embrace, the [Root.AurilLocAdj] priests dress you in nothing but a smock and a pair of boots. Then they begin the ritual that will conjure up the blizzard you will need to brave in order to prove your devotion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.20a;I will prove myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DEATH_AURIL_EMBRACE;was judged unworthy by [Root.AurilLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.21;You don't know how long you have been walking through the blizzard, but you have started to feel an odd sensation - you are feeling warm, even though your limbs as sluggish. A great sense of fatigue overtakes you. Maybe resting wouldn't be so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.21a;I'll just... close my eyes for a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.22;Though you have been walking through the blizzard for what feels like too long, you endure. The cold bites at you, saps your strength, but by sheer determination and the favour of [Root.AurilLoc], you persevere. You have a feeling there isn't much more to go now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.22a;Faith will preserve me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.23;The cold remains, but it no longer seems to bother you. It becomes comforting, even. Instead of disorienting you, the blizzard seems to shelter you. You can feel a presence, infinitely greater than yourself, watching over you. As the blizzard dies down, the priests confirm what you already know.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.23a;The Frostmaiden is with me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.24;Searching for a target of your violence while ranging in enemy lands, you come across [combatant_2.GetBestName]. It doesn't take long to back [ecombatant_2.GetHerHim] into a corner and initiate a deadly confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.24a;Fight, and die!;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.25;After contacting the local [Root.GaragosLocAdj] priests and giving them money for their trouble, you stand at a Blood Festival. To honor the Reaver, a mighty creature is slain and its flesh is eaten raw, while its blood is used by the priests to perform benedictions upon the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.25a;Victory for [Root.GaragosLoc]! Now and always!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39240;There are rumors that one of the [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers in the Realms is employing a heathen in their court. This is not acceptable to the Church, and this earthly lord will surely be damned unless we intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39243;An emissary has returned from [From.GetBestName] bearing glorious news. The emissary says that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to imprison a heathen that was in [From.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA39243;Praise be!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39244;This is a day that the has caused cries of joy to rise up from the Wall of the Faithless. An emissary from  [From.GetBestName] is stating that [From.GetSheHe] refuse to follow our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA39244;My [Root.GetPatronHighGodName], why have you forsaken me?;;;;;;;;;;;x
