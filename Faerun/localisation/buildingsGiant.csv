###Hill Giant Tribal###
tb_steading_1;Mud Hovels;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_1_desc;Hill giants in general, are stupid, arrogant, and gluttonous. They do not build mighty fortresses, nor do they conduct what we call agriculture. Instead, they live a life of raiding, bullying, and habitual feasting, in that order. Thankfully, only a small tribe resides here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_2;Crude Steadings;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_2_desc;In rare cases, when Hill giants are allowed to grow in population, they begin erecting crude steadings. Much like a house, save built for giant size, these steadings are often built around the chiefs hall. This tribe has begun to dominate the region, and few things can stop them now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_3;Rough Camps;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_3_desc;Hill giants do not build with organized planning in mind. Unless the chief directly knocks it down, most giants build wherever they please. This is not the case here, as with the tribes increasing wealth, the disparate steadings have begun to form defensive rings, centered around the chiefs hall.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_4;Hill Forts;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_4_desc;A mighty chieftain has cemented their power here. Among the hills and valleys, hillforts constructed from the very trunks of trees and rocky cliffs have emerged. Countless slave warriors and chattel pens surround these forts, all of which circles the chiefs grand feast hall.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_1;Boulder Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_1_desc;All giants, regardless of their origin, enjoy throwing mighty boulders. Sadly, this ruler has only a meagre pile of rocks to offer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_2;Throwing Pitch;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_2_desc;This field is littered with craters and crimson stains. Here, all giants partake in their favorite past time, competing in games of strength, distance, and occassional accuracy. It is not uncommon after a successful raid, for captives to be made into moving targets or worse, ammo.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_3;Rock Range;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_3_desc;Booms and thunderous clashes can be heard miles away from this range, as teams of giants are drilled into the art of the throw. Each giant, is trained to become a living siege weapon, for few castles could withstand such a barrage of stone from these warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_1;Refuse Creeps;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_1_desc;Hill giants are a filthy race by nature. Their constant feasting, lack of cleanliness, and hardy bodys, means little to nothing bothers them. This filth attracts the usual scavengers, such as ropers,  gelatinous cubes, and even an oytugh which live in or near the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_2;Squalor Squatters;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_2_desc;As the tribe grows, so too does it's unwanted guests. Like rats in a human city, the giants are generally unbothered by these creatures, being too large and difficult to kill of course. They do serve an unofficial purpose in keeping the tribe relatively clean, as well as slowing down besiegers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_3;Trash Kings;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_3_desc;Though Hill giants are not known for their husbandry, or any animal handling skills, they make up for this by bullying weaker creatures. Here the local chief has forced the various beasts to serve him, with strategic trash sites, and releasing the caged beasts on the eve of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_1;Chiefs Tent;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_1_desc;Even the lowliest of hill giant chieftains, ensures that he has the best hovel out of the tribe. Even if that means it's just a few trees tied to form a makeshift teepee.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_2;Chiefs House;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_2_desc;Finally, a proper roof over the chieftains head has been erected. Large enough to house his personal family, and a few loyal guards. This up and coming chief still has a long way to go however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_3;Chiefs Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_3_desc;From the squalid mud fields, to a rightful lords hall, this hill giant has built a home which dwarfs even barbarian kings. Fiercesome beasts prowl around, trophies from far a field decorate its walls, and the raucous laughter of warriors speaks of an ongoing feast.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_1;Straggling Nomads;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_1_desc;Though some of the oldest of giantkin can barely recall the legends of Ostoria, they still claim to be the rightful overlords of Faerun. This is easier said than done, when conquering desert terrain. Thankfully, a few enterprising nomads come baring goods.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_2;Nomad Outposts;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_2_desc;Giants as a rule, require more food to sustain themselves than the small races. Even the smallest of giant populations require a kings feast every day, let alone those settled under the scorching desert sun. The few nomads have organized themselves, and come once a season with camels ladened with precious food.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_3;Nomad Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_3_desc;From the unruly hill giants to the thunderous storm giants, the nomads are begrudgingly welcomed. Even so far in some tribes to have special quarters, fit to house them. During the off season, these more settled nomads offer their services as calvarymen, a rare role in any giant army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_4;Nomadic City.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_4_desc;It is undeniable that in this province, the once nomadic people of the desert have begun to coexist with their giant overlords. Older giants, those who recall the legends of Ostoria, remark that this is what it may have once been like. Regardless, this province provides not only food, but much wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_1;Loathsome Prisoners;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_1_desc;Out of the giant race, Hill giants are one of the few who actively hunt and eat the smaller races. Their ravenous hunger, and lack of morals, gives them no qualms when devouring such sapient creatures. Occassionally, a chieftain saves a few prisoners for more twisted purposes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_2;Rowdy Captives;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_2_desc;Hill giant tribes are often a conglomeration of other species. Bullying or enslaving the smaller races, it is not uncommon to see goblinoids, orcs, and even human slaves toiling under their giant overlords. Rarely do such creatures live past a single generation, but a few eek out an existence.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_3;Broken Servants;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_3_desc;When the giants march to war, they often endeavor to take as many prisoners as possible. This tribe in particular has kept a sizeable population under their leash, even going so far as to employ them in battle. Often underfed, abused, and cowardly, these slaves are only meant to be meatshields.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_4;Chattel Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_4_desc;This tribe has grown so powerful, that whole tribes of humanoids have been enslaved under them. Despite the ravenous hunger, squalid conditions, and dangerous beasts that roam such dens, these poor creatures live out their lives, generation after generation under the cruel giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_1;Ogre Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_1_desc;There exists a long and complicated history between the true sons of Annam, the all-father, and Vaprak, the destroyer. Ogres in particular are often bullied by the true giants, forced to be mere slaves and camp guards. Still, they are tougher than regular humanoids, and share a similar enough culture with hill giants to be unbothered.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_2;Ogre Guards ;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_2_desc;In more populous tribes, Hill giants often employ ogres to be camp guards and slave masters. The ogres in return only ask for food and shelter, which any repsectable giant tribe could provide. Questions of loyalty, and if the ogres worship Vaprak, the enemy of the Ordning, are best left unasked.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_3;Ogre Clans;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_3_desc;Ogres are ferocious fighters, ever hungry, and war-mongers by nature. Legends speak of the old armies of Ostoria, with legions of ogres and other giantkin following the thunderous march of the giants. Thus, even to this day, it is not rare to see small clans of ogres joining hill giant tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_4;Ogre Tribe;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_4_desc;With the growth of the Hill giants, this tribe of ogres has committed itself to their cause. Promised food and much booty, these warriors march under the giants banners, wrecking and reaving across the land.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_1;Chefs Tent;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_1_desc;Ogres and Hill giants, are similar in culture, if not in stature. Both have a ravenous hunger, both have no qualms eating sapient creatures, and both think they are some of the greatest creatures on Faerun. Their arrogance is often humbled, but nothing infuriates these creatures more than a meagre feast hall, or worse, no hall at all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_2;Cooks Kitchen;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_2_desc;Finally, the chieftain of this province has ordered his people to build a proper kitchen. Feeding an army is a monumental task, let alone feeding creatures that can eat cows whole. As long as this chieftain keeps the food coming, more warriors will come to the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_3;Mess Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_3_desc;Entering this building as a smaller race is a death sentence. Here ravenous beasts chew anything within reach of their greasy hands. A small army of cooks is busy slaughtering anything edible, and even the chieftain is busy gorging himself on fine meats. The warriors are without a doubt eager for battle, and flock to this mighty chiefs table.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_4;Smokehouse;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_4_desc;From across the hills and mountains, warriors large and hungry march forth simply to dine at this feast hall. Mutton stuffed halflings, fine kebab elf, and roasted barbarian steaks, are but the entrees for this never ending feast. Grolantor himself, god of gluttony, would weep to find such a banquet.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_1;Lone Tinkerers;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_1_desc;The more bestial races, such as Ogres and Hill giants, are not known for their craftmanship. Instead relying on the looted booty of other races, it has dawned on some members of their race to keep a tinkerer or two around.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_2;Grim Craftsmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_2_desc;Taken from the slave stock, these wretches have demonstrated some skill in creating and repairing armor. Chained to their shops, they'll spend all day hammering and smelting armor for their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_3;Bloody Smithy;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_3_desc;The hot forges and clang of hammer can be heard at all hours. Cruel ogre slave masters rule here with an iron hand. Given but the barest necessities to survive, these armorers and weaponsmiths work not just for fear of life, but what their overlords would do to their families.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_4;Sweat Shop;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_4_desc;This tribe marches with crude yet effective armor. Rough iron and belted trunks for shields, hammer heads the size of anvils, and swords the length of spears. This terrible host is fearsome indeed, for an armored giant is nigh unbeatable on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_5;Dwarven Forges;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_5_desc;Very rarely do Hill giants get the opportunity to enslave dwarven prisoners. Not only do they rival Fire giants in craft, and can find precious ore as well as Stone giants, dwarves are unfortuneately smarter than Hill giants to be caught. Yet here we are, and the wealth flows, thanks to dwarven labor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_1;Totem Pole;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_1_desc;The Ordning, is an integral part of giant society, regardless of specific race. Part of this highly stratified society is the worship of their ancestor god. Each giant breed is supposedly descendent from one of Annam's many sons. Here the tribe has erected a small shrine in honor of their patron.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_2;Mouth of Grolantor;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_2_desc;A giant totem statue of Grolantor, the gluttonous god of the Hill giants. Though not blessed with creativity or craftmanship, this idol is of the highest quality for Hill giants. Here the priests tell stories of the ravenous god, imparting curious parables often involving feasting, eating, and hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_1;Fire Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_1_desc;Here in the countryside is where Hill giants thrive. And part of that is their surprising level of food storage. A Giant's storehouse is the most guarded building, rivaling it's chieftain and priest. Alas, this place has but only a common fire pit to roast local cows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_2;Larder;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_2_desc;As a culture dedicated to feasting, eating, and hunting, the preservation of food and cooking plays a heavy role. Gluttons, the ceremonial leaders of the tribe, are in charge of the food stores. The greater the stock, the larger the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_3;Cattle Pens;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_3_desc;Though infamous for it's raiding, the constant need to feast and stave off the hunger has led some intelligent giants to try herding. Often given to the elderly members of the tribe, their main duties are to fatten the cattle before the big feasts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_4;Pantry;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_4_desc;A respectable pantry is filled to the brim with a tribes most exotic and choice meats. Griffins, lions, bears, and of course, humanoids. At times resembling a cruel zoo or prison, a giant's pantry is often times the most clean and organized out of the whole camp. A bastion of order in the tribes chaotic lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantdam_1_desc;Perhaps the one feat of engineering the Hill giants can boast, is their characteristic attempt at creating massive damns on local rivers. The result of this is apparent, for the giants gain fresh water, richer fishing grounds, and dominance in the area by ransoming the water from those downstream.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_1;Goblin Wretches;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_1_desc;Only quite recently was this province ruled by an independent goblin tribe. The new giant overlords have decided that colonizing the province to be too expensive. They've instead begun the painful process of training these new found slaves into useful warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_2;Goblin Hunters;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_2_desc;One would think that giving your slaves bows and arrows a mistake. True for more typical slavers, but giants have little fear of being shot in the back, with armor as thick as an anvil for some, with skin as tough as rock for others. Not to mention the 'convincing' tactics the giants employ.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_3;Goblin Spearmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_3_desc;The weakness of giants is often apparent to anyone who sees them. Cut them down below the waist, and they'll fall. Though an individual giant can crush many humans at once, it is still vulnerable to lances and long axes. Thus the goblin spearmen encircle their overlord, offering both protection and killing power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_4;Goblin Rough Riders;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_4_desc;Giant armies suffer from a rigid composition. Their warriors throw boulders for skirmishing, and later charge once the enemy closes in. Unsurprisingly, enemy armies have learned to rely on speed and maneuverability to avoid them in battle entirely. Thus enters the goblin rough riders. Their sole purpose is to chase and slow down the enemy long enough for the giants to later crush them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stuffstuff_1;Stuff Stuff;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stuffstuff_1_desc;The smaller small folk, serve little to no purpose for the vicious Hill giants. They are weaker than regular humanoids, constantly escaping, and in general steal from their proper overlords. However, Hill giants have over the centuries developed a game based entirely around the smaller folk. Stuff stuff is a simple game, in which the winner is whoever can shove as many halflings or gnomes into their mouth. Giants of all ages enjoy the game, the soon to be dead small folk not so much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_1;Shadowed Woods;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_1_desc;Voadkyn, or as they call themselves, 'Wood Giants' are the sons of Othea and Ulutiu. They are elusive, indifferent, and generally in the middle of giantkin society. They are not as fanatically opposed as the Firbolgs, nor as zealoulsy devoted as the Virbeeg. Nor do they hold a hatred for Annam, as fomorians do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_2;Guarded Glades;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_2_desc;Voadkyn are perhaps the more friendly of the giantkin race. Being peaceful neighbors for elven and fae folk, they are often described as the peaceful giants. This reputation, coupled with their soft history with true giants, allows them to act as much needed intermediarys with the great forest kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_3;Hedge Mazes;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_3_desc;What forms the basis of the Ordning for the Voadkyn, is their sense of gardening. So famed is their skill, they have grown magical hedge gardens even as far as the frozen north.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_4;Treasure Gardens;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_4_desc;The curious nature of the Voadkyn, as well as their general aloofness, has produced a great treasure. Within their communities, legends speak of a great horde of gold and gems, hidden deep within their magic gardens. True or not, the wood giants are not telling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_1;Troll Nest;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_1_desc;Most sane races will actively hunt down and slaughter troll nests and their various dens. However, most races are not true giants. Trolls are perhaps the most hardy breed of creature on Faerun, capable of adapting to any environment. That, and being commonly bullied by true giants to do their bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_2;Troll Warren;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_2_desc;This giant overlord, whether mad or genius, has desired to let the troll population grow in this province. What mad purpose do they scheme for? The trolls instinctively worship Vaprak the Destroyer deity, and are not true sons of Annam.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_1;Orc Grunts;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_1_desc;Orcs are fierce, territorial, and capable of being a threat to even ogre slave masters. As such, this province uses them sparingly, though a more daring chieftain may try to go further.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_2;Grumbling Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_2_desc;Compared to humans, elves, and other slaves, an orc is the ideal servant. Tribal by nature, with a culture respecting the strongest, as well as being capable of surviving the horrors of Hill giant camp life, one must still be wary of them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_3;Mercenary Guards;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_3_desc;Orcs are better suited to fighting, than toiling away as slaves. Though to ensure loyalties, they are often paid in gold or a share of the loot. Effectively mercenaries, it does no good to point out the technical detail of who enslaved the other.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_4;Orc Commandos;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_4_desc;Given adequate arms, and even a place of respect in the tribe, Orcs are not incapable of allying with Hill giants, just as Ogres tend to do. Still, racial, cultural, and religious tension exists, with gold and booty being the only means of keeping the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Hill Giant Castle###
ca_giant_steading;Stone Fort;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_desc;The Hill giant chief of this land, grows bold enough to style themself civilized. Though the humans would laugh, and the elves would act insulted, no ruler could deny the fiercesome sight of this mighty stone castle. It's crude, roughshod appearance betrays the fact it houses an army of 15 foot warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_2;Pit Traps;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_2_desc;Beyond the immediate countryside, lays various pockmarked fields. Though not dangerous enough for giants, capable of stepping over them in a single bound, they are still deep enough to slow an invading army down.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_3;Boulder Traps;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_3_desc;Hill giant enginuity is often described as blunt. Surrounding the castle entrance, and the chiefs house, a giant need only roll one stone to cause the rest to fall. Time consuming to clean up for giants, death for anyone smaller.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_4;Dry Moat;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_4_desc;Acting as a crude latrine in times of peace, this rarely dry moat acts as a barrier for besiegers and any enemy army. Not necessarily advanced technology, but effective by Hill giant reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_5;Starved Prophets;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_5_desc;A Mouth of Grolantor is a paradox of Hill giant society. Neither loved nor hated, these abused beasts are starved during times of peace, only to be unleashed as raging machines of death, consumed only with the desire to satiate their hunger or die trying. A last ditch effort, even for Hill giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg;Strange Kin;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_desc;The Verbeeg are perhaps the most unnerving of kin tolerated in giant tribes. Spawn of Ulutiu, the destroyer of old Ostoria, these giant-kin are surprisingly amicable. Eager to please, quick-witted, and seemingly knowing too much. More suspicious giants warn of these strangers, but Hill giants are sadly not the most wise of giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_2;Shifty Giants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_2_desc;Verbeeg are notorious thieves, brigands, and speakers of half-truths. Yet despite this, they are strong proponents of the Ordning, offering their services from meagre Hill giants to towering Storm giants. Here the Verbeegs have made themselves a small enclave in the castle. Keeping to themselves, they whisper of things unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_3;Eyes of Karontor;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_3_desc;The Elders warn of the Verbeeg. They speak of great underground kingdoms, ruled by the most cunning Verbeeg kings. That behind our back, they plot foul deeds against us all. Still, the eyes of Karontor are a small price to pay, for such excellent service. For now, they serve us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields;Stomping Fields;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_desc;A field outside the castle dedicated to games of sport and exercise, for even Hill giants understand the need for fun. Here is where the young compete, and the old teach, in all the fine details of boulder throwing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_2;Rock Ball;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_2_desc;The origins of rock ball are unknown. Perhaps learned from the various tribes of man and orc the giants have encountered, or one of giant origin, matters little. The game is one in which two teams of giants try to knock each other out with boulders. The team with no more players left standing loses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_3;Strong Arm Competitions;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_3_desc;In the odd day when Giants get bored of boulder throwing, they often try out different things. Tree sized javelins, cannonballs in cargo nets, and of course, log tossing. Though never as popular as the boulder, the exercise and novelty of it energizes them, making them better warriors for it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit;Dank Dungeons;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_desc;Make no mistake, the tribal habits of the Hill giants are still filthy. But instead of letting the vermin creatures roam free around the stone keep, they are kept in foul dungeons deep below. Waiting for the moment when their jailers will unleash them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_2;Black Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_2_desc;A fortress of this size offers protection to many creatures. From Hill giant warriors, humanoid slaves, and of course, that which lurks below. Kept in iron cages, and fed the scraps of the castle, they are starved and dangerous beasts. Many slaves are threatened merely by mention of the Pit.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ca_monster_pit_3;Lurking Horrors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_3_desc;Hill giants are not threatened by such creatures nor in serious danger. Capable of bullying these vermin as well as a human, they have amassed quite a collection here. Ropers, oytughs, oozes and slimes galore. A veritable monster zoo found here on Faerun.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep;Lords Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_desc;This Hill giant is no mere chief. Gone are the tribal days of filth ridden huts and squalid mud hovels. A proper lords hall fit for an aspiring giant king. A rare sight of engineering for such a typically dumb race.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_2;Warrior Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_2_desc;In this hall alone rests the chieftains finest warriors. From towering Hill giants, to fierce ogre spearmen, they all stand by to guard their lord in both times of peace and war;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_3;Giant Armory;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_3_desc;Inside this massive room is enough iron and steel to house an army, though just enough to arm a giant lords personal guard. Forged from the labor of slaves and prisoners, the weaponry is said by some cursed, while others believe it good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery;Scruplous Traders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_desc;Hill giants offer little in terms of trade. They'll purchase food of course, but generally they offer little in terms of craft. That is of course, for civilized merchants. For those who deal in dark arts or foul schemes, the flesh trade is always profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_2;Flesh Markets;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_2_desc;The giant lord has cleared a space inside the castle walls for a most unwholsome purpose. Ushered by brutal ogre guards, they parade forth from the castles dark heart. Merchants from far Calimsham and Zhentil Keep are here to do business;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_3;Slaver Chiefs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_3_desc;Dependent on the season, you could see the whole of Faerun under these walls. Merchants of flesh, trading in wares exotic and foul. Whispers of demonic traders haunt the castle walls, yet the giant lord fears not. The gold is flowing through his walls, and into his coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe;Ogre Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_desc;Hill giants are not the most cordial of their race, but of the Ogres they feel a mutual understanding. Here in the castle, Ogres are given their own quarters to train, arm, and prepare themselves for battle. In return they are given shelter under the giants roof, and a share of the loot.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_2;Runt's Armory;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_2_desc;Here is where the ogres are equipped with heavy spear and iron armor. Usually a wild and undisciplined mercenary force, now they are capable of surviving the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_3;Chief Ogres;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_3_desc;Typically, ogres are simply bossed and bullied by the giants into following orders. But after years of service and loyal dedication, the giant lord here has decided to grant further autonomy. Now they are led by a chief of their own choosing, they fight better, rarely breaking under pressure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nomadcity;Nomad Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nomadcity_desc;Long have the desert nomads lived these lands, and longer still when the sands of time devour it all again. Through good trade, diplomacy, and simple fortune, the nomads have purchased free quarters to call their own. Now when the trade season starts, giants and nomad mingle within the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_1;Reeky Fisherboats;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_1_desc;Hill giants are the last giants one would believe to be sailors. They lack intelligence, craft, and general interest in the water outside of seafood. Still, the giant lord demands his army capable of crossing any ocean. Ogres are given the lofty goal of building the ships, and manning them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_2;Wet Feet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_2_desc;Despite all expectations, the Hill giants are seaborn. Their ships are crude, often stolen, and one good hit away from sinking. Yet they are sturdy enough to ferry a few giants and their ogre slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_3;Creaky Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_3_desc;Kings of the sea beware, the giants have amassed a flotilla of their own. Galleys the size of dragons, oared by ogre sailors, rowing to the beat of the giant's drum. Truly both miracle and terror for Faerun, as now the rapacious looters can now reach any shore, no mere body of water a barrier.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1_desc;Perhaps the one feat of engineering the Hill giants can boast, is their characteristic attempt at creating massive damns on local rivers. The result of this is apparent, for the giants gain fresh water, richer fishing grounds, and dominance in the area by ransoming the water from those downstream.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_1;Herders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_1_desc;Giants are not expert shepherds nor experts at husbandry. But a 15 foot giant can quite easily bully a cow like it's a runty goat. The smokehouses are some of the most culturally important buildings in Hill giant society, and it is with herder steaks they feed upon when the winter comes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_2;Gatherers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_2_desc;Perhaps the closest to merchants for Hill giant society, they endeavor to either purchase the food giants simply cannot hunt or herd. Of course, civilized merchants tend to make great profit off of the gluttonous beasts, for they care little about gold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_3;Hunters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_3_desc;Though Hill giants would eat anything, they still have certain tastes. Some prefer their meats raw, boiled, cooked, grilled, and even stewed. The many culinary tastes of the Hill giants is deceptive to outsiders, hence why hunters are tasked with the laborious task of gettng said meat in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_4;Hoarder;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_4_desc;Hoarders are mainly responsible for stocking and keeping the pantry organized, the one act of orderliness for such a messy race. Though the smokehouse itself is chaotic, behind every smokehouse is a well organized team of hoarders and fetchers to keep it running.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_5;Fetchers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_5_desc;The title of Fetcher is not the most glorious position, yet it has much potential. Smokehouses are typically organized and ran by a Glutton, who often delegates the tedious work to his Fetchers. A powerful glutton will often have scores of Fetchers under him, with one or two poised to inherit the position of Glutton.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_1;Blood Fields;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_1_desc;While the slaves toil in the forges, those who have strong backs will work the fields. Though Hill giants typically lack the patience for farming, they understand enough of it to force others to do it. With more slaves working the fields, the giants are free to take up arms for more glorious tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_2;House Staff;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_2_desc;The giant lord has determined a creature as powerful as him, needs as many servants to cater to his petty needs. Free from the horrors of the pit, the forge, and the fields, one would be mistaken to believe this is a better life. At any moment a servant may find themselves an impromptu snack by bored guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_3;Surface Mines;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_3_desc;Hill giants are not miners by nature. They can muscle themselves a cozy cave with a bit of effort, but generally know little of it's delicate details. A Hill giant mine is perhaps the most dangerous and lethal mine in Faerun, prone to cave ins, monster attacks, and the uncaring hunger of their own gaolers spell death for the miners.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_1;Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_1_desc;As proper for any respectable giant lord, this ruler has dedicated space in the castle for the worship of the giant gods. Giving praise to Annam, the all-father, the shrine is then divided between his family, in roughly equal praise. Here any giant, regardless of breed, can find time for worship.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2a;Shrine to Ruk;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2a_desc;Ruk, the terrestrial, the progenitor, King of all Hill giants. Born of Annam's union between Othea the earth mother, Ruk is the traditional patron of Hill giants. By dedicating this castle in his name, we attract more conservative giants, as well as performing maat, by honoring our ancestor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2b;Shrine to Grolantor;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2b_desc;Grolantor, god of gluttony, war, and hate in the giant pantheon. Born of Annam's union between the mother sky, he was once forbidden in interfering with the children of Othea. By dedicating this castle in his name, we attract warmongers and warriors, as well as earning glory by battling under his name.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_1;Thick Locks;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_1_desc;As one of the most important buildings in all of Hill giant society, the pantry is heavily guarded. Not just from potential thieves, but from the ravenous and stupid hunger of it's own people. Only the Glutton and his trusted Hoarder have access to this building.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_2;Soaring Undercroft;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_2_desc;A dark, dank cellar, this room is gigantic, with vaulted walls reaching the size of small churches. This underground lair is where some of the most prized ingredients are stored, brought out only on holy feast days.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_3;Enormous Brewhouse;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_3_desc;The art of brewing is not entirely lost on Hill giants. Though it'll never compete with dwarven ale, or elven wine, a giants beer, or jotunbrew, is strong enough to kill a bull twice over. Usually brewed by one of the Gourmands, the giants will often drink barrels of it during feast days.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_4;Cheese Cave;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_4_desc;Hill giants enjoy good cheese, if not more than any race. As such, within their pantries you'll be hard pressed to find dishes without it. The only trouble is that when left to forment for too long, pesky cheese molds begin to gain sapience. Many a hapless slave has been devoured by the cheesey beast.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_5;Gourmands House;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_5_desc;As chief cook for the castles garrison, the gourmand is an often thankless job. Still, it is a position with perks. Often gaining respectable size in their tribe, gourmands often times become a lesser noble with their impressive bulk. Still, when the tribe is on the move, the gourmand must follow, and with him a small army of under cooks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1_desc;Perhaps the one feat of engineering the Hill giants can boast, is their characteristic attempt at creating massive damns on local rivers. The result of this is apparent, for the giants gain fresh water, richer fishing grounds, and dominance in the area by ransoming the water from those downstream.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_1;Slave Levy;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_1_desc;These wretches have long since been enslaved by their giant overlord. Whether by force, or simply have given up, they fight as frontline skirmishers, and if needed, as meatshields.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_2;Slave Host;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_2_desc;Under the ogres whip, these warriors march into certain doom. Only the rough riders have a chance at ever living, or bold enough, to flee after the battle. The host knows only war and misery, under the Hill giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_1;Stuff Stuff;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_1_desc;The smaller small folk, serve little to no purpose for the vicious Hill giants. They are weaker than regular humanoids, constantly escaping, and in general steal from their proper overlords. However, Hill giants have over the centuries developed a game based entirely around the smaller folk. Stuff stuff is a simple game, in which the winner is whoever can shove as many halflings or gnomes into their mouth. Giants of all ages enjoy the game, the soon to be dead small folk not so much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_2;Halffoot Ball;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_2_desc;Invented by an enterprising Ogre named Joh Mad, this game is played with live shortfolk as the ball, as two teams of Hill giants (or ogres) try to take the "ball" to a goal post usually across the field. A newly made sport, giants everywhere cheer at the spectacle of seeing players chase after the ball as it tries to escape. The balls coincidentally need constant replacing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_3;Fullfoot Ball;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_3_desc;Hailing from the southern lands, as far as Zakhara and Maztica, this variant of halfoot ball requires the players to kick the ball across the field, instead of carrying it. This sport quickly runs out of balls, but the fans love it nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn;Wood Giant Foresters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn_desc;The Wood Giants are a reclusive, insular race of giantkin. Born of Ulutiu and Othea's affair, they are in the middle when it comes to kin and jotunbrud relationships. It will take considerable gold to earn their trust, but if won, powerful allies are made available.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn_2;Secret Glades;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn_2_desc;The Voadykn are a dour people, but not in spirit. To them, nature and her bounty is a beautiful gift that must be protected. With a strong affinity for druidic magic, entire communities and tribes can be hidden inside of glades. Legends speak of the vast horde of gold hidden within said glades, but the wood giants are not telling otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_troll_den_1;Troll Den;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_troll_den_1_desc;The giant lord of this castle has housed a small tribe of trolls inside it's deepest dungeons. Dangerous even to true giants, trolls are still ruled by the strongest, but any question of loyalty can never be sure. They are the spawn of Vaprak, the Destroyer, a common enemy of the Ordning.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_1;Orc Clan;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_1_desc;It takes a lot of gold to make an Orc your friend. It takes a strong arm and more gold than a halflings weight to convince a clan to fight for you. Mercenary orcs are a clear distinction above their tribal cousins. Disciplined, well-equipped, and loyal as long as the gold comes, they are a professional fighting force many lords would desire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_2;Clan Chiefs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_2_desc;The clan has grown considerably. So much so, that distinctions have arose between them, and between Orcs, a clan difference is as wide as a halflings waist. For the giant lord, this means more troops, albeit quarrelsome ones, but professionals nonetheless. Just as long as the chiefs are given their proper due.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Hill Giant City###
ct_cattleking;Stray Cows;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_desc;Hill giants are not experts at herding cattle, but strong rope, a good crook (giant sized of course) can go a long way. A Hill giant is tending his cows, with a few servants attending as guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_2;Runty Flock;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_2_desc;The Hoarder Chief demands much, and it's up to the lowly herders to answer his demands. A small herd of cattle can be seen out in the fields, but the servants outnumber them greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_3;Meagre Herd;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_3_desc;A large number of cows can be seen grazing, enjoying the peaceful watch of their giant herders. Enough for any baron, a small amount to feed a giant ruled city however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_4;Modest Stampede;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_4_desc;With the blow of his horn, the herder chief summons his servants for the cattle march. Any fool careless enough to come near the herd will usually be crushed by boulders, or worse, trampled.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_5;Roving Hoofs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_5_desc;The land surrounding the city is often a minefield of droppings. These droppings usually attract vermin, which in turn attract predators. The herder chief must be on constant alert, for threats as minor as goblin poachers, to herd killing threats like Rocs and Dragons.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_6;Cattle King;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_6_desc;This herder chief has now become a Cattle King, a great title amidst civilized giant society. His herd boasts mighty bulls, hefty heifers, and enough giant drovers and stockers to rival a small army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_1;Sleepy Eyes;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_1_desc;Hill giants are perhaps the worst guards, if not for their size and strength. Though often employed by their superior brothers, in those scenarios they are often drilled into disciplined warriors. For other Hill giants, they tend to shirk responsibility. Still, a giant guard is worth at least ten men, so all is not lost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_2;Grumbling Bellies;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_2_desc;In Hill giant society, feasting, gorging, eating, indulging, etc, are all part of their daily life. If they're not eating, a Hill giant is often unfocused. Sadly, this means guard duty is some of the most despised line of work, as there is little time for snacks. Still, giant guards will still defend buildings of worth, such as the pantry and feast hall zealoulsy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_3;Idle Hands;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_3_desc;It is not uncommon to catch Hill giant guards competing in games. Too dumb for sophisticated card games, the brutes prefer rolling dice, arm wrestling and tormenting whatever poor servant walks by.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_1;Great Stomping;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_1_desc;Hill giant cities, rare as they are, typically are conquered from other races. As most citizens of the old regime are enslaved, eaten, or driven off, what is left is useless buildings too small for the Giants to use. What is left after a "great stomping" is used to house their many servants and slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_2;Mad Traders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_2_desc;You may ask, who possibly visits a city ruled by Hill giants? They offer little in trade, create nothing, and are generally hostile to all smaller people. Such dens of filth are usually visited by other Hill giants, who usually bring chests and barrels of spoils, such as gold, jewelry, and unusable armor. In short, desperate and mad merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_3;Shoddy Walls;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_3_desc;Walls as humans build them, are little barriers for giants. When giants build walls, even dumb Hill giants understand the concept of bigger is better. A mix of hard rock and logs stacked as high as possible, a Hill giant city is a crude, rude, and ugly thing, but effective.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_4;The Big city;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_4_desc;After many years, the servants and slaves of the Hoarder chief, have rebuilt a portion of this city. Though never as grand as what it was, or could be, this city has finally adapted to their new overlords, with streets large enough for both species to traverse, and shops tall enough to admit giant customers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_1;Master Gourmand;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_1_desc;The Hoarder chief has hired a Master Gourmand, one capable of cooking the finest meats and dishes. Of course, Hill giants have little taste or culinary skill as humans know it. Regardless, a Gourmand is a chef of the highest skill, and brings with him much prestige, and if lucky, a loyal following.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_2;Cooks Entourage;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_2_desc;For good or ill, the Gourmand has attracted many competitors to the city, and with it a slew of lesser cooks. This increase in quality food, has near doubled the original population of the city. Many warriors it seems, have come to this land of culinary skill.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_3;Hells Kitchen;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_3_desc;The market square is bustling with traders, each eager to part with valuable ingredients such as manticore steaks, myconid portbellos, and even gorgon chops. The issue however is that many of these fine ingredients are still very much alive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_4;Gourmet Dining;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_4_desc;With the ever increasing demand for more and more food, especially of higher taste, many of the rivaling Gourmands have put aside their differences to establish their very own school. Trained in the culinary arts, these Gourmands now train young Gourmets, in the art of fine dining. Perhaps one day, the Hill Giants can make a dish palpable for human consumption.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_1;Bloody Spears;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_1_desc;An Ogre tribe has not only allied itself with the Hoarder chief, but has settled within the walls of the city. Ogres tend to follow the strongest, and are easily bribed. Thus it comes as no surprise they help police the city, as well as serve as the occasional slavemaster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_2;Rude Skirmishers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_2_desc;Dressed in little to no armor, these ogres mainly focus on keeping the enemy far away, while the giants crush them with boulders. Inferior to say, an Elven unit, these are still hardy soldiers, capable of throwing heavy bullets with their slings, as well as chucking mighty spears before the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_3;Poor Marksmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_3_desc;Ogres are perhaps the worse bowman ever hired to serve an army. How they make up for this, is with the sheer size of their bow. Capable of drawing a bow twice the size of a man, they are capable of shooting in the vague direction of the enemy, while the sheer size of the arrow is enough to skewer some poor fool.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_4;Rugged Unit;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_4_desc;A motley crew of mercenaries, this tribe of ogres have produced a fine company of warriors, skilled enough in spear, bow, and mace. Perfect for bullying the smaller races, as well as marching into battle for the Hoarder Chief.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_1;Ghostly Stalls;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_1_desc;It was but only recently that this city was populated by civilized, neat, and upstanding citizens. But then the Hill giants came, with their boulders, clubs, and feral beasts of war. As no surprise, the once bustling market is empty, save for guards on a punitive watch.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_2;Spooked Peddlers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_2_desc;The Hoarder chief has open the city up again for trade. To no ones shock, the market is still empty. Of course, a few merchants do come, but since the Hill giants only ever purchase food, little profit yet exists to attract the flow of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_3;Bold Mongers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_3_desc;The markets once again host merchants, though this variety is of ill repute. Hailing from far Zhentil keep, these traders bring weapons and slaves. Hill giants, unphased by such dealings, are eager to do business.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_4;Nervous Traders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_4_desc;Hill giant society cares little for what civilized merchants usually offer. But where Hill giants dwell, there are occassional servants and slaves who squirrel enough gold for the odd purchase. The market guards, bored and uninterested Hill giants, don't stop slaves from entering the market. This is normally fine, but such lax security leads to occassional muggings and daylight robbery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_5;Unhappy Merchants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_5_desc;The Hoarder chief has, over time, earned a fair enough reputation for business. The merchants who do come to the city are either heavily armed, surrounded by guards, or powerful enough to slay giants outright. The marketplace therefore is quiet, dour, and tense during trade. The giant guards who stand watch, are more to establish authority, than to actually help poor merchants who comes under a rivals wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_1;Shadow Port;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_1_desc;A sea port is a dangerous, seedy place in the best of cities. For a Hill giant ruled one, the port is practically under anarchy, with few ships daring to land unless heavily armed. As such, the Hoarder chief has ordered his ogres to guard the port, and keep the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_2;Burly Steves;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_2_desc;The labor of an ogre, if properly placated, is twice that of an average man. Though not the most gallant stevedore, an ogre is more than capable of loading cargo into ships.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_3;Rowdy Marines;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_3_desc;Ogres are riotous, contentious, and generally smelly. Thus they are perfect sailors. Offering their services to more savage sea captains, ogre marines can hoist cannons, load cargo, and slaughter boarding pirates. As long as they are fed, the sailors life is little different from the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_1;Reeky Fisherboats;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_1_desc;Hill giants are the last giants one would believe to be sailors. They lack intelligence, craft, and general interest in the water outside of seafood. Still, the Hoarder chief demands his army capable of crossing any ocean. Ogres are given the lofty goal of building the ships, and manning them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_2;Wet Feet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_2_desc;Despite all expectations, the Hill giants are seaborn. Their ships are crude, often stolen, and one good hit away from sinking. Yet they are sturdy enough to ferry a few giants and their ogre guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_3;Creaky Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_3_desc;Kings of the sea beware, the giants have amassed a flotilla of their own. Galleys the size of dragons, oared by ogre marines, rowing to the beat of the giant's drum. Truly both miracle and terror for Faerun, as now the rapacious looters can now reach any shore, no mere body of water a barrier.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_1;Giant Temple;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_1_desc;Despite all appearances, Hill giants, like their brothers, are deeply religious. Granted the constant feasting, raiding, and general slavery of smaller races, it is hard to believe. In this massive log temple, giants of all breeds can give worship to mighty Annam, the all father.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_2;Shrine to the Ancestors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_2_desc;There is a distinct line of theology that all giants understand. The gods of their pantheon, the celestial sons of Annam, and the ancestors, the terrestrial sons of Annam. In this shrine, the giants give worship to their sacred forefathers. For any giant, they must be able to recite their family line, all the way back to Annam.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_3;Shrine to the Gods;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_3_desc;Annam had many children, some legitimate, others not so much. Regardless, every member of Annam's house is respected under this shrine. From mighty Stronmaus, to little Iallanis, the only distinction is between those few members ousted from the pantheon. Of those, few giants give actual praise, and often in secret.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg;Criminal Families;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_desc;Verbeeg are shifty, sneaky, and general grifters in Giant society. Abhoring the concept of private property, and strangely zealous of the Ordning, they are a polarizing race for sure. And as this city has fallen to Giant hands, it was only a matter of time for a Verbeeg clan to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_2;Strong Arm Thugs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_2_desc;Verbeeg stand almost near the bottom in the Ordning, a step above humans depending on which Giant you ask. As such, the Verbeeg hold a curious stance on the Ordning. Whereas Firbolgs abandon it wholeheartedly, and Voadkyn avoid it as much as possible, they embrace it despite their low stature.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_3;Notorious Narcs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_3_desc;The way Verbeeg's Ordning is structured, favors intelligence, cunninng and general skill in subterfuge. The only way to rise in their society is to outwit and defeat their superiors. Such skullduggery, as well as rumors of worshipping Karontor, the Twisted, gives ample reason for any giant to distrust these lesser kin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_4;Eyes of Karontor;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_4_desc;Karontor the Twisted, is a long since banished deity of the Ordning. It is said that Karontor is evil first, anything else second. A spiteful, envious deity, he primarily associates with Verbeeg and Fomorians, offering them magic, patronage, and occassional wisdom. At this point, the local Verbeeg population is too strong to oust, as we have unwittingly let Karontors eyes in our city.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_1;Guarded Workshops;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_1_desc;Most of Hill giant society is too busy focused on getting their next meal, let alone in the art of crafting the necessary tools that keeps a city running. Therefore the Hoarder chief has declared huge warehouse be occupied with slaves, to mass produce the many arms and armor for his army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_2;Regimented Hours;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_2_desc;All across the warehouse floor, slaves toil to the beat of the giant's  drum. Ogres brandishing cruel whips and barbs, keenly look for any dereliction of duty, however tiny. The slaves are worked long hours, and when the bell rings, they're ushered out, only for the next, fresher batch to take their place. Creating a never ending shift to produce the Hoarder chiefs weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_3;Ogre Bosses;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_3_desc;By maximising synergy between the Ogres whip, and the slaves back, our CTO (Chief Torturer Orge) predicts an increase in weapon production ten fold. As we speak, implementing new ergonomic designs has commenced. Instead of chaining the slave to the workstation, they're chained to the one next to them. Ensuring easy worker change when it's time to rotate in a new crop of workers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry;The Giant's Pantry;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_desc;Save for their temple, a pantry is one of the most sacred buildings for Hill giants, perhaps rivaled by the feast hall itself. When Hill giants conquer a city, if not pillaged to the last stone, can easily become the greatest pantry of all. But for now there's just a respectable one here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_2;Loyal Spencers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_2_desc;Hill giants do not typically rule or occupy cities. Their society is primarily tribal, with but a few ambitious chieftains holding castles. To own a city, fundamentally changes their way of life. Yet, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Now the Hoarder chief has created a new system of titles, such as Spencers, whose job it is to manage the various mini pantry rooms adjacent to the main one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_3;Buttery Butlers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_3_desc;In a city so large, even one hosting Hill giants, the need for specialized roles soon develop. The Buttery butlers are in charge of keeping the Hoarder chiefs special pantry stocked with butter, as well as wines and liquor. Comparable to a human nobles passion for cheese and crackers, the Hoarder chief enjoys fine butter and wine with his meals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_4;Hanging Meat Garden;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_4_desc;This special room is where all the various meats are hanged, cured, and occassionaly dried. Delivered straight from the chief butcher, the sight can be quite horrifying for the uninitiated, given that Hill giants typically dine on humans.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_5;Skulking Scullery;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_5_desc;You'd be surprised at how much water is needed to wash a giant size plate, let alone make it hygienic. City giants are typically different from their tribal cousins in the fact that they don't eat with their bare hands. Yes, they do prefer pitchforks and and a good sword to cut their food. Rumors of the far eastern varierty using sticks to eat is of course preposterous.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_6;Cooler Cellar;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_6_desc;A great underground dungeon filled to the brim with ice elementals. How the Hill giants did this incredible feat of magical summoning, let alone restrain them, is a mystery. Perhaps they petitioned their Frost giant brothers, a local wizard was paid heavily, or some other means. Regardless, now the Hoarder chief and his family enjoy iced drinks and frozen treats all year round.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_1_desc;Behold the greatest engineering achievement of the Hill giants. By throwing enough logs and mud, they are able to dam up any river or local lake. The result is anyone downstream losing access to precious water, fish, and angry giants upstream demanding tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_2;Fisher Huts;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_2_desc;With the large lake forming around the dam, there are a few Hill giants who've taken to fishing. Some are not the brightest, wading in the water and splashing around trying to catch them by hand. Still, for some, simply sitting by the water getting drunk and pulling in a net with the daily catch is quite the high life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_3;Netter Stations;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_3_desc;It didn't take long for the Hill giants to figure out the easiest and simplest way to fish. By setting up large stations in the water with their nets, they need only wade out and pull in the catch. Truly the pinnacle of fishermen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_4;Deadliest Catch;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_4_desc;For the few Hill giants who've taken to fishing, there are some who crave a bit more excitement. Typically these are the ones who enjoy raiding and plundering, thus incorporate it into their hobby. These brave fools actively comb the waters for dangerous sea life. Serpents, sea elfs, kuo toa, and the occassional sahuagin. Foolish or not, they say the food tastes better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
