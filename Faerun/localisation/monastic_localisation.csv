monastic_order_sun_soul_desc;The Sun Soul monks follow a monastic tradition that they believe has its roots in the ancient empire of Netheril. In their philosophy, living things harbor a fragment of the sun's mystic essence within them. Just as the body has a shadow, so too does the spirit have a light. To get in touch with their internal light, Sun Soul monks follow a strict code of ascetic conduct called the Precepts of Incandescence: to seek physical perfection, to seek spiritual virtue, to shine light into darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;x
