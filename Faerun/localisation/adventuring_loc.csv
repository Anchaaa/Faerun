title_party_member_desc;You can assemble a party of four adventurers and send them on quests. Quests can challenge many different skills and attributes, not just combat skill, so make sure to create a party with a diverse skill-set.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
adventuring_quest;Assign a Quest;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring_quest_desc;You can send the adventuring party you have assembled on a quest. Your party will be faced with various challenges, and their lives will be at risk. If they succeed, they'll gain experience points, gold and artifacts, and they'll bring something valuable back for you. You'll have to pay them a fee, though.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#

anti_host_adventuring_desc;You can send the adventuring party you have assembled against an host leader that is targeting you.

# Difficulty Selection Screen & Starting Adventure Tombola
EVTDESC_ADVN_1;The adventurers you assembled are ready for some action! They have identified several locations within your lands that are overrun with dangerous creatures and apparently rich with ancient treasure. Will this expedition be remembered as a disaster, or as a great deed?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ADVN_1_b;The realm is under attack by landless outlaws. Our adventurers are ready to deal with this threat: by removing our enemies' leader, their forces will disperse, sparing us the trouble of having to go to war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZ_ADVN_1;We have rookies in need of experience, here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPADVN105;This is a safer and extremely simplified adventure option for rookie adventurers. Only lower level characters will actually get experience points, and there will be no special events, or artifacts rewards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_1;Let's go for something simple, yet challenging.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ADVN_1;They're ready for real danger.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ADVN_1;Good luck, heroes!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ADVN_2;A battle! Your party is being assaulted by a mob of monsters. A party member must take point and fight the enemy leader, while the rest fend off the minions. Who's going to?;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Bad Weather
EVTDESC_ADVN_3;All of a sudden, the weather goes from decent, to bad, to absolutely terrible. The party must find shelter as soon as possible, but who's the best person for this job? Martially inclined characters are going to be better at this, as are druids, barbarians and rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Negotiate With Locals
EVTDESC_ADVN_4;The local populace isn't too happy with heavily armed strangers roaming their land as they please. If only your adventurers could befriend them, these peasants might offer them shelter, directions and supplies, instead of being an annoyance. Who's going to act as the party face? Diplomacy is key, paladins, bards and shadows are great at this.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Research Location
EVTDESC_ADVN_5;While the party has a general idea on where their destination is located, they don't have exact coordinates. Hitting the books for a few days would help with that. Who's going to delve into dusty tomes and frayed parchments? Learned characters are going to be better at this, especially wizards, bards and warlocks.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ADVN_6;The adventurers hear suspicious noises ahead: dangerous creatures lurking about, surely. By being stealthy, the party might be able to avoid this fight. Who's going to lead this stealth mission? Rogues, shadows and monks are the best at this, and being good at intrigue is also going to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Forage
EVTDESC_ADVN_7;The party's supplies are running dangerously low, and the adventurers are nowhere near a place where they could buy some. They'll have to rely on foraging and hunting from this point on. Who's going to take care of this task?

# Pinpoint Dungeon
EVTDESC_ADVN_9;The whole area is littered with old ruins, small and large.

Before delving in, they have the chance to rest a bit and mend some of the minor wounds they have sustained so far. Who's going to act as party medic?

# Trap
EVTDESC_ADVN_12;The signs are clear: broken skeletal remains, dried blood splatters, pressure plates...this place is full of traps. A party member will have to try disarming them, or at least locating them before somebody gets hurt. Who's going to handle this dangerous task?

# Strange Magic
EVTDESC_ADVN_13;The party comes upon a strange room, where wild magical phenomena seem to happen at random: flying rocks, small fiery explosions, sudden whirlwinds, and more. Navigating this place safely won't be simple. Learned characters are going to be better at this, and arcane casters like sorcerers, wizards and warlocks are perfect for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ADVN_30;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Bad Ending
EVTDESC_ADVN_31;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. Even worse, the foul [final_boss.GetFirstName], angered by the attempt on [final_boss.GetHerHis] life, has assembled a large host and is going on a rampage as we speak! This in now a military matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_31;What a disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ADVN_32;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. You won't be able to assign them a quest for a while. Some local clerics have offered to heal their wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Host Leader
EVTDESC_ADVN_33;This is the final battle! Your adventurers have cornered [final_boss.GetFirstName] and [final_boss.GetHerHis] most trusted lieutenants. If your adventurers can take this opponent down, the realm will be safe again... who's going to engage [final_boss.GetFirstName] in personal combat?;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Good Ending Post-Host Leader
EVTDESC_ADVN_35;Success! Your adventurers have returned home heavy with spoils, and [final_boss.GetFirstName] is no more. A hero's welcome - and magical healing, courtesy of the local priesthood - awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_35;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Bad Ending Post-Host Leader
EVTDESC_ADVN_36;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. Even worse, the foul [final_boss.GetFirstName] is unharmed, and well aware of your attempt to kill [final_boss.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_36;Damn it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Healing Opportunity & War Camp Adventure Tombola
EVTDESC_ADVN_37;Your party has reached the location of the main enemy camp. Before beginning their infiltration, they have a chance to rest a bit and mend some of the minor wounds they have sustained so far. Who's going to act as party medic?

# Mercenary Thugs
EVTDESC_ADVN_40;Your party encounters a band of unsavory mercenary types along the road, and they seem to be looking for trouble. Perhaps violence can be avoided. Who's going to act as the party face? Diplomacy is going to be key, and a fighter is more likely to command the respect of these thugs.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Passage Blocked
EVTDESC_ADVN_41;Exploration was going well, but suddenly the party reaches a dead end, as the passage they were traversing is blocked by fallen rocks. They'll now have to take the long way around, unless they can press through by brute force. Who's going to try?

# Non-Hostile Monsters
EVTDESC_ADVN_42;The adventurers were ready for battle, but they run across an unexpectedly calm group of monsters. These creatures seem content to live peacefully in this place, but the party must traverse their territory. Someone has to parlay, convincing them the team isn't here to fight.

EVTDESC_ADVN_43;The local taverns and gambling dens are full of seedy mercenary types. With the right approach, some of them could become excellent sources of information.

# Diversion
EVTDESC_ADVN_47;The enemy leader is too well guarded - what the party needs is an effective diversion, something that can lure enough soldiers away from their posts. Who's going to handle this?

EVTDESC_RAID_17;[province_raid_target.GetName] was filled with horses and cattle. Our raiders have rounded up a large flock in the main square so that I can decide which ones to pick for myself and what to do with them.;Les terres de [province_raid_target.GetName] étaient remplies de chevaux et de bétail.

# Random Monster
EVTDESC_RAID_18;Your raiding party is being assaulted by a mob of monsters. Battle is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_18;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Bad Weather
EVTDESC_RAID_19;All of a sudden, the weather goes from decent, to bad, to absolutely terrible. The raiding party must retreat or find shelter as soon as possible, or face dire consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_19;We won't give up now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_20;Your raiding party encounters a band of unsavory mercenary types along the road, and they seem to be looking for trouble. Perhaps violence can be avoided?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_20;We're not looking for a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RAID_20;Bah! Let's just take them down.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_21;There's no place for compassion or empathy during a raid. There's only blood, violence, and loot.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_21;Raiding isn't for the faint of heart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RAID_22;There's no place for fear during a raid, far away from home, with enemies lurking everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_22;Raiding isn't for the faint of heart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_23;While on a raid, killing or hurting innocent people is practically unavoidable. Someone is bound to seek revenge for those slights.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_23;That's just how it is.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_24;Raiders are often violent brigands and outlaws, but that doesn't mean they can't have a good time together. In fact, it's pretty common for friendships to grow between comrades in arms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_24;That's nice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RAID_24;No, I need to focus on important things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_25;Raiders aren't usually the nicest or the most agreeable people. Today, some of your raiders have decided to bring their usual squabbling to the next level - serious insults are flying, and knives are being drawn.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_25;This is a matter better solved with words.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RAID_25;A show of brute force should calm them down.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_50;This year's raid is finally over, and much loot has been brought home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_50;Let's celebrate!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RAID_51;The premature death of our raiders' appointed leader means our raid is over. Better luck next time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_51;Disappointing...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RAID_52;A band of raiders led by the vile [raider_leader.GetFullName] has managed to loot and pillage the lands around [province_raid_target.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_52;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_53;One of our courtiers has been taken captive by a band of raiders, led by the rapacious [raider_leader.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_53;Perhaps I should have set some patrols...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_54;Our patrols have managed to repel a band of raiders led by the vile [raider_leader.GetFullName]. The surviving raiders are currently retreating from the lands around [province_raid_target.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_54;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_RAID_100;Unfortunate circumstances forced us to end our raid before we had a chance to finish it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RAID_100;Oh well.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC20222B;My [Root.GetMyMarshalName], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has gathered up a host of raiders and outlaws, convincing them serve the realm as regular soldiers, at least for the time being.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20224B;The raiding party my [Root.GetMyMarshalName] gathered up to fight for me have grown tired of military life and are now leaving to find fortune elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA20224B;Best of luck.;;;;;;;;;;;x
