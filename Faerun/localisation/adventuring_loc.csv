title_party_member;Adventurer;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_party_member_desc;You can assemble a party of four adventurers and send them on quests. Quests can challenge many different skills and attributes, not just combat skill, so make sure to create a party with a diverse skill-set.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
adventuring_quest;Assign a Quest;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring_quest_desc;You can send the adventuring party you have assembled on a quest. Your party will be faced with various challenges, and their lives will be at risk. If they succeed, they'll gain experience points, gold and artifacts, and they'll bring something valuable back for you. You'll have to pay them a fee, though.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
anti_host_adventuring;Send Adventurers Against;;;;;;;;;;;x
anti_host_adventuring_desc;You can send the adventuring party you have assembled against an host leader that is targeting you. If they succeed, they'll gain experience points, gold and artifacts, and the threat to your realm will be eliminated. You'll have to pay them a small fee, though.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Difficulty Selection Screen & Starting Adventure Tombola
EVTDESC_ADVN_1;The adventurers you assembled are ready for some action! They have identified several locations within your lands that are overrun with dangerous creatures and apparently rich with ancient treasure. Will this expedition be remembered as a disaster, or as a great deed?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ADVN_1_b;The realm is under attack by landless outlaws. Our adventurers are ready to deal with this threat: by removing our enemies' leader, their forces will disperse, sparing us the trouble of having to go to war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZ_ADVN_1;We have rookies in need of experience, here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPADVN105;This is a safer and extremely simplified adventure option for rookie adventurers. Only lower level characters will actually get experience points, and there will be no special events, or artifacts rewards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_1;Let's go for something simple, yet challenging.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ADVN_1;They're ready for real danger.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ADVN_1;Good luck, heroes!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Random Monster
EVTDESC_ADVN_2;A battle! Your party is being assaulted by a mob of monsters. A party member must take point and fight the enemy leader, while the rest fend off the minions. Who's going to?;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Bad Weather
EVTDESC_ADVN_3;All of a sudden, the weather goes from decent, to bad, to absolutely terrible. The party must find shelter as soon as possible, but who's the best person for this job? Martially inclined characters are going to be better at this, as are druids, barbarians and rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Negotiate With Locals
EVTDESC_ADVN_4;The local populace isn't too happy with heavily armed strangers roaming their land as they please. If only your adventurers could befriend them, these peasants might offer them shelter, directions and supplies, instead of being an annoyance. Who's going to act as the party face? Diplomacy is key, paladins, bards and shadows are great at this.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Research Location
EVTDESC_ADVN_5;While the party has a general idea on where their destination is located, they don't have exact coordinates. Hitting the books for a few days would help with that. Who's going to delve into dusty tomes and frayed parchments? Learned characters are going to be better at this, especially wizards, bards and warlocks.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Sneak Past Enemy
EVTDESC_ADVN_6;The adventurers hear suspicious noises ahead: dangerous creatures lurking about, surely. By being stealthy, the party might be able to avoid this fight. Who's going to lead this stealth mission? Rogues, shadows and monks are the best at this, and being good at intrigue is also going to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ADVN_6_b;The adventurers hear suspicious noises ahead: guards on patrol, surely. By being stealthy, the party might be able to avoid this fight. Who's going to lead this stealth mission?

# Forage
EVTDESC_ADVN_7;The party's supplies are running dangerously low, and the adventurers are nowhere near a place where they could buy some. They'll have to rely on foraging and hunting from this point on. Who's going to take care of this task? Martially inclined characters are going to be better at this, as are druids, barbarians and rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Lost in the Wilderness
EVTDESC_ADVN_8;After a long day of marching, the party realizes they have been walking in circles for a while, and they need to get their bearings right, fast. Who's going to act as party guide? Martially inclined characters are going to be better at this, as are druids and rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Pinpoint Dungeon
EVTDESC_ADVN_9;The whole area is littered with old ruins, small and large. Finding the correct dungeon entrance by dumb luck would take a while...perhaps the party can pinpoint the correct location through clues, logic and educated guesses. Characters with high learning are going to be the best at this task.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Healing Opportunity & Dungeon Adventure Tombola
EVTDESC_ADVN_10;Your party has reached the location of the dungeon they aim to explore and loot. Before delving in, they have the chance to rest a bit and mend some of the minor wounds they have sustained so far. Who's going to act as party medic? Learned characters are going to be better at this, and those capable of casting healing magic will be the best.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Trap
EVTDESC_ADVN_12;The signs are clear: broken skeletal remains, dried blood splatters, pressure plates...this place is full of traps. A party member will have to try disarming them, or at least locating them before somebody gets hurt. Who's going to handle this dangerous task? Rogues and shadows are the best at this, and being good at intrigue is also useful.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Strange Magic
EVTDESC_ADVN_13;The party comes upon a strange room, where wild magical phenomena seem to happen at random: flying rocks, small fiery explosions, sudden whirlwinds, and more. Navigating this place safely won't be simple. Learned characters are going to be better at this, and arcane casters like sorcerers, wizards and warlocks are perfect for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Final Boss
EVTDESC_ADVN_20;This is the final battle! The ruthless [final_boss.GetFirstName] stands before the party, accompanied by a host of minions.

# Good Ending Post-Final Boss
EVTDESC_ADVN_30;Success! Your adventurers have returned home richer, better armed and more confident than ever. They even brought back a valuable gift for you! Some local clerics hurry to heal their wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_30;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Bad Ending
EVTDESC_ADVN_31;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. Even worse, the foul [final_boss.GetFirstName], angered by the attempt on [final_boss.GetHerHis] life, has assembled a large host and is going on a rampage as we speak! This in now a military matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_31;What a disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ADVN_32;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. You won't be able to assign them a quest for a while. Some local clerics have offered to heal their wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_32;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Host Leader
EVTDESC_ADVN_33;This is the final battle! Your adventurers have cornered [final_boss.GetFirstName] and [final_boss.GetHerHis] most trusted lieutenants. If your adventurers can take this opponent down, the realm will be safe again... who's going to engage [final_boss.GetFirstName] in personal combat?;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Good Ending Post-Host Leader
EVTDESC_ADVN_35;Success! Your adventurers have returned home heavy with spoils, and [final_boss.GetFirstName] is no more. A hero's welcome - and magical healing, courtesy of the local priesthood - awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_35;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Bad Ending Post-Host Leader
EVTDESC_ADVN_36;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. Even worse, the foul [final_boss.GetFirstName] is unharmed, and well aware of your attempt to kill [final_boss.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_36;Damn it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Healing Opportunity & War Camp Adventure Tombola
EVTDESC_ADVN_37;Your party has reached the location of the main enemy camp. Before beginning their infiltration, they have a chance to rest a bit and mend some of the minor wounds they have sustained so far. Who's going to act as party medic? Learned characters are going to be better at this, and those capable of casting healing magic will be the best.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Mercenary Thugs
EVTDESC_ADVN_40;Your party encounters a band of unsavory mercenary types along the road, and they seem to be looking for trouble. Perhaps violence can be avoided. Who's going to act as the party face? Diplomacy is going to be key, and a fighter is more likely to command the respect of these thugs.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Passage Blocked
EVTDESC_ADVN_41;Exploration was going well, but suddenly the party reaches a dead end, as the passage they were traversing is blocked by fallen rocks. They'll now have to take the long way around, unless they can press through by brute force. Who's going to try? Strong warriors are the best at this, and being martially inclined is also going to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Non-Hostile Monsters
EVTDESC_ADVN_42;The adventurers were ready for battle, but they run across an unexpectedly calm group of monsters. These creatures seem content to live peacefully in this place, but the party must traverse their territory. Someone has to parlay, convincing them the team isn't here to fight. Diplomacy is key, paladins and bards are especially good at this.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Persuade Local Thugs
EVTDESC_ADVN_43;The local taverns and gambling dens are full of seedy mercenary types. With the right approach, some of them could become excellent sources of information. Who's going to do the talking? Diplomacy is key, with bards being predictably good at persuasion. Fighters are also more likely to command the respect of these thugs.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Plan Attack
EVTDESC_ADVN_44;Assaulting a military camp to take out the enemy leader is no small feat. Breaking in without a strategy, is basically suicide. Who's going to lead the planning effort?

# Random Patrol
EVTDESC_ADVN_45;Infiltration was going smoothly, then suddenly, somebody yelled "Who goes there?", followed by the unmistakable sounds of steel being drawn.

# Drug Supplies
EVTDESC_ADVN_46;The adventurers located the camp's supply depot. If they could drug the supplies with sedatives, infiltration would become much easier. Who's going to stealthily drug the supplies?

# Diversion
EVTDESC_ADVN_47;The enemy leader is too well guarded - what the party needs is an effective diversion, something that can lure enough soldiers away from their posts. Who's going to handle this? The flashy magic of wizards, sorcerers and warlocks would be perfect for this, and high learning can help.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Blend In
EVTDESC_ADVN_48;Disguised as enemy guards, the party was making swift progress through the camp - then, a drunken group of soldiers decided to start a brawl. A manipulative person may be able to talk their way out of this one. Diplomacy is key, with bards, shadows and sorcerers being especially favored.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Nosy Priests
EVTDESC_ADVN_49;Disguised as enemy guards, the adventurers were managing to progress unnoticed - then, they caught the eye of a few warpriests, who started berating them for not respecting some important religious custom, or something. This could devolve into a brawl...unless a learned person, like a cleric, wizard or paladin, can defuse the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Asks ruler if they want to adventure
EVTDESC_ADVN_107;Adventuring is dangerous business, with a high chance of suffering death or a life-changing injury. It's also an activity that is considered beneath the standing of a powerful ruler. You could still engage in it, if you so wish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
