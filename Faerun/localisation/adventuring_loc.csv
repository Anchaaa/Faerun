title_party_member;Adventurer;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_party_member_desc;You can assemble a party of four adventurers and send them on quests. Quests can challenge many different skills and attributes, not just combat skill, so make sure to create a party with a diverse skillset.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
adventuring_quest;Assign a Quest;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring_quest_desc;You can send the adventuring party you have assembled on a quest. Your party will be faced with various challenges, and their lives will be at risk. If they succeed, they'll gain experience points, gold and artifacts, and they'll bring something valuable back for you. You'll have to pay them a fee, though.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Difficulty Selection Screen (eventually) & Starting Adventure Tombola
EVTDESC_ADVN_1;The adventurer party you assembled is ready for some action! They have identified a location within your lands that is overrun with dangerous creatures and, apparently, rich with ancient treasure. Will this expedition be remembered as a disaster, or as an epic deed?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_1;I'm sure they're ready for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Random Monster
EVTDESC_ADVN_2;A battle! Your party is being assaulted by a mob of monsters. A party member must take point and fight the enemy leader, while the rest fend off the minions. Who's going to?;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Bad Weather
EVTDESC_ADVN_3;All of a sudden, the weather goes from decent, to bad, to absolutely terrible. The party must find shelter as soon as possible, but who's the best person for this job? Martially inclined characters are going to be better at this, as are druids, barbarians and rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Negotiate With Locals
EVTDESC_ADVN_4;The local populace isn't too happy with heavily armed strangers roaming their land as they please. If only your adventurers could befriend them, these peasants might offer them shelter, directions and supplies, instead of being an annoyance. Who's going to act as the party face? Diplomacy is going to be key here.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Research Location
EVTDESC_ADVN_5;While the party has a general idea on where their destination is located, they don't have exact coordinates. Hitting the books for a few days would help with that. Who's going to delve into dusty tomes and frayed parchments? Learned characters are going to be better at this, especially wizards, bards and warlocks.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Sneak Past Enemy
EVTDESC_ADVN_6;The party hears suspicious noises ahead of them: dangerous creatures lurking about, surely. By being stealthy, the adventures might be able to avoid this fight. Who's going to lead this stealth mission? Rogues, shadows and monks will be the best at this, and being proficient at intrigue is also going to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Forage
EVTDESC_ADVN_7;The party's supplies are running dangerously low, and the adventurers are nowhere near a place where they could buy some. They'll have to rely on foraging and hunting from this point on. Who's going to take care of this task? Martially inclined characters are going to be better at this, as are druids, barbarians and rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

### Lost in the Wilderness ###
EVTDESC_ADVN_8;After a long day of marching, the party realizes they have been walking in circles for a while, and they need to get their bearings right, fast. Who's going to act as party guide? Martially inclined characters are going to be better at this, as are druids, barbarians and rangers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Pinpoint Dungeon
EVTDESC_ADVN_9;The whole area is littered with old ruins, small and large. Finding the correct dungeon entrance by dumb luck would take a while...perhaps the party can pinpoint the correct location through clues, logic and educated guesses. Characters with high learning are going to be the best at this task.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Healing Opportunity & Dungeon Adventure Tombola
EVTDESC_ADVN_10;Your party has reached the location of the dungeon they aim to explore and loot. Before delving in, they have the chance to rest a bit and mend some of the minor wounds they have sustained so far. Who's going to act as party medic? Learned characters are going to be better at this, and those capable of casting healing magic will be the best.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Final Boss
EVTDESC_ADVN_20;This is the final battle! The ruthless [final_boss.GetFirstName] stands before the party, accompanied by a host of minions. If your adventurers can take this fiend down, riches, loot and glory will be right ahead...who's going to engage [final_boss.GetFirstName] in personal combat?;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Final Boss keeps fighting
EVTDESC_ADVN_21;The desperate battle rages on, and [final_boss.GetFirstName] is still standing. Who's going to trade blows with [final_boss.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Good Ending
EVTDESC_ADVN_30;Success! Your adventurers have returned home richer, better armed and more confident than ever. They even brought back a valuable gift for you!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_30;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Bad Ending
EVTDESC_ADVN_31;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. Even worse, the foul [final_boss.GetFirstName], angered by the attempt on [final_boss.GetHerHis] life, has assembled a large host and is going on a rampage as we speak! This in now a military matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_31;What a disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ADVN_32;Failure! Your adventurer party have sustained casualties, and the survivors were forced to retreat. You won't be able to assign them a quest for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ADVN_32;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
