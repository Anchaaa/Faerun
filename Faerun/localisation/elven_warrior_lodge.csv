warrior_lodge_elven_desc;The Elven race is known for their bladesingers and arcane archers, magic users who blend martial arts and spellcasting into unique disciplines. There are many styles of bladesinging, although they can be divided into three main families: Cat, Bird and Snake. Arcane Archers study a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into arrows to produce unusual supernatural effects. Regardless of their school and style, all of these warriors act as defenders and watchers of their people and lands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
