knight_order_golden_cup;Knights of the Golden Cup;;;;;;;;;;;x
knight_order_golden_cup_desc;The Order of the Golden Cup is a knightly order within the faith of Ilmater, the Crying God. The Order devotes itself to the healing and defense of the innocent, the weak, the sick, and others who cannot protect themselves. Its members are generally peaceful and always try to help, and rarely do they seek out evil to slay. They are not pacifists, however, nor opposed to such actions, and do not hesitate to fight when confronted by evil.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
knight_order_golden_cup_leader_desc;The Ilmatari have a fairly loose and informal hierarchy, preferring to make decisions through a governing council.;;;;;;;;;;;x
