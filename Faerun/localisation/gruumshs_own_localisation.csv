warrior_lodge_orcs_desc;The patron god of the orcs loves fighting for its own sake, constantly pushing his people to create and engage in the pain, conflict, and strife that he relishes. Traditional orcish culture is extremely warlike and when not at war the race is usually planning for it. Most orcs approach life with the belief that to survive, one has to subjugate potential enemies and control as many resources as possible, which put them naturally at odds with other races as well as each other.;;;;;;;;;;;x
