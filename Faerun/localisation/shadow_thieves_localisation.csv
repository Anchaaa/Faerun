The former Open Lord now rules alone, obviously backed by the Shadow Thieves behind the scenes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Shadow Heist Quest
EVTDESC_STH_1432;Greetings, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]. Soon, a great auction of magic items will take place in a realm not far from your base of operation. Do I need to say more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Get past the guards
EVTDESC_STH_1433;It's the night before the auction. All the precious magic items that are supposed to be auctioned tomorrow are already in the building, which is, as expected, under heavy surveillance. Your fellow shadow thieves look at you, their guildmaster. How do you want to handle this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_STH_1433;Mercenaries are easily swayed by gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_STH_1433;I have planned for this. No one will see us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_STH_1433;Kill them all, let the gods sort them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_STH_1433;I didn't expect this to be so risky. Let's leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#You're in
EVTDESC_STH_1434_A;Thanks to a massive bribe, you easily convinced the guards at the entrance to look the other way. You're inside the auction house, but you don't have enough time to loot the entire place. What are you looking for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_STH_1434_B;Your infiltration plan went smoothly. You're inside the auction house, but you don't have enough time to loot the entire place. What are you looking for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_STH_1434_C;The guards at the entrance never saw you coming: you and your fellow thieves killed them quickly and silently. You're inside the auction house, but you don't have enough time to loot the entire place. What are you looking for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_STH_1434;I want a magic weapon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_STH_1434;I need to find where they keep magic armor and shields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_STH_1434;Where's the enchanted jewelry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_STH_1434;Enchanted clothing is what I'm looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#You get caught
EVTDESC_STH_1435_A;Your infiltration plan went well, at first. Then one of your adjutants messes up and accidentally breaks a vase or something. A lot of noise occurs. In less than a minute, you're surrounded by the auction house's guards. The city watch will also be here soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_STH_1435_B;Your team silently killed a few guards, but one managed to call for help. Now you find yourself facing overwhelming odds, as the auction house's guards and the city watch surround you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_STH_1435;Damnation! I must surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_STH_1435;I'll kill anyone in my way! No one can stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
