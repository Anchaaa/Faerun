tp_druid_circle;[Root.DruidLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_desc;[Root.DruidLoc]s are places of great mystic power, tapping deep into the laylines of the earth. From young shepherds to Archdruids, as long as but a single one lives, the circle will as well. By constructing this building, great magic can be worked.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_2;Secluded Den;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_2_desc;In this hidden lair, deep in the wilds of the world, is a small cache of books, parchments and minor food stock. A meager waystation for traveling druids and rangers, it is often where the Circle rests before their clandestine meetings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_3;Minor Circle;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_3_desc;Druidic circles are not a fixed location, but rather a collective group. As time moves on, more successful groups eventually acquire membership of fae and sylvan creatures. With such power, the circle is better able to influence the region.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_4;Druidic Village;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_4_desc;What was once a secluded den of druids, has grown into a whole village. Whether living in great tree homes, or in fungal groves, these druids have become great guardians of the wilds, often hosting smaller fae and injured animals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_5;Menhir Stones;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_5_desc;With the growth of power, the circle has decided to settle in one location. Often atop great sites of natural power, the druids begin erecting a great Menhir circle, marking the outlines of their territory. Often large stones, they are marked with magical runes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_6;Altar of Nature;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_6_desc;As the Menhirs rise, an altar dedicated to one of the many deities of nature is built. Whether to peaceful Mielikii or wise Titania, the altar is the pact, a symbol of their loyalty and dedication to the forces of nature. As a result, the Circle is heavily guarded.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_7;Great Circle;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_7_desc;A great complex of standing stones constructed in a pattern magical, surrounds a sacred alter. On full moons, a host of Druids, led by the Archdruid, discuss matters temporal and spiritual. From lonesome trees to the heart of the wild, their power is felt everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
