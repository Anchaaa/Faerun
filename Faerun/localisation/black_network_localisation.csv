#using ruthless tax
EVTDESC_ZHE_21000;Wealth keeps flowing through one of my provinces. The peasants already have adequate food and lodging, what do they need more money for? As a powerful and responsible ruler, I should appropriate all of that gold, before it gets spent on something... frivolous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_21000;Let's proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_21000;Not a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#how to apply the ruthless tax
EVTDESC_ZHE_21100;There's always more than one way to skin a cat. I could simply take the gold whenever I want through force, but would a different method be more appropriate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Steward presents trade route
EVTDESC_ZHE_10102;Your steward comes to see you one afternoon. Apparently, many Zhentarim merchants are reporting a new, extremely convenient trade route near your realm. The route would be highly profitable, but it seems to be infested by monsters and other…unpleasantries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10102;Let’s organize a raiding party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10102;I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Land trade route
EVTDESC_ZHE_10103;Adventuring in the wilderness, hunting for monsters and bandits, is never easy, and rarely cheap. Our raiding party will need supplies, beasts of burden and a good wage, or this expedition will fail before it even begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10103;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10103;We can pillage as we go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10103;No, this is far too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Naval trade route
EVTDESC_ZHE_10104;Adventuring on the high seas, hunting for monsters and pirates, is never easy, and rarely cheap. Our soldiers will need supplies, ships and a good wage, or this expedition will fail before it even begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10104;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10104;We’ll engage in a bit of piracy, ourselves..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10104;No, this is far too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
