EVTDESC_ZHE_102;So, you want to join the Black Network. Serve us well, and you'll be greatly rewarded, because the entire world will serve us, eventually. Cross us, and you won't live long enough to regret it. Deal?;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
#using ruthless tax
EVTDESC_ZHE_21000;Wealth keeps flowing through one of my provinces. The peasants already have adequate food and lodging, what do they need more money for? As a powerful and responsible ruler, I should appropriate all of that gold, before it gets spent on something... frivolous.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_21000;Let's proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_21000;On second thought, not a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#how to apply the ruthless tax
EVTDESC_ZHE_21100;There's always more than one way to skin a cat. I could simply take the gold whenever I want through force, but would a different method be more appropriate?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_21100;Some minor tax concessions for the next few years should placate them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_21100;Ugh, just take the gold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_21100;Make a deal with the local thieves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#scheming for leadership
EVTDESC_ZHE_500;It's happening. My position inside the Black Network is extremely strong, and I can finally stake a claim to the Zhentarim title. Who should align myself with, though?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_500;The Church of Bane has many allies and a strong position.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_500;Praise the Dark Sun, our lord Cyric!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_500;Wait, I might be making a terrible mistake here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZHE_500;I will carve my own path.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_ZHE_501;High ranking members of the Black Network have been questioning your soft leadership for a while now. More and more of them have distanced themselves from you, and it's now clear that you no longer hold any authority over the Zhentarim organization.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_501;Maybe it's for the best, they're evil people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Marshal presents trade route
EVTDESC_ZHE_10102;Your marshal comes to see you one afternoon. Apparently, many Zhentarim merchants are reporting a new, extremely convenient trade route near your realm. The route would be highly profitable, but it seems to be infested by monsters and other unpleasantries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10102;Let us organize a raiding party.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10102;I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Land trade route
EVTDESC_ZHE_10103;Adventuring in the wilderness, hunting for monsters and bandits, is never easy, and rarely cheap. Our raiding party will need supplies, beasts of burden and a good wage, or this expedition will fail before it even begins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10103;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10103;We can pillage as we go.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10103;No, this is far too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Naval trade route
EVTDESC_ZHE_10104;Adventuring on the high seas, hunting for monsters and pirates, is never easy, and rarely cheap. Our soldiers will need supplies, ships and a good wage, or this expedition will fail before it even begins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10104;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10104;We shall engage in a bit of piracy, ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10104;No, this is far too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Vassal asks for a massacre
EVTDESC_ZHE_10105;Aware of my preparations, one of my vassals has asked for a little favor. Around the area that I planned to clean up, lives a tribe of natives. My vassal wants them dead, plain and simple. A sizable gift is ready for me if I happen to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10105;It would be my pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10105;Get out of my sight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Heading out
EVTDESC_ZHE_10111;All is ready. Time to eliminate everyone foolish enough to oppose the Black Network.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10111;This trade route shall be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#Rival nation
EVTDESC_ZHE_10114;I should have seen this coming: a rival nation is trying to disrupt our operations. Are the Harpers behind this interference? Hard to say at this point, but whatever the case, we shall not let anyone stop us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10114;Hire more mercenaries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10114;I have a lot of contacts among their own merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10114;Time to contact our spies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZHE_10114;No further measures are needed. I think?;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#guerrillas
EVTDESC_ZHE_10116;Our enemies are not brave enough to challenge us in battle openly. Instead, they harry our expeditionary force with guerrilla tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10116;I know how to deal with those worms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10116;Is my marshal slacking off?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10116;Everything is fine...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#massacre or not
EVTDESC_ZHE_10118;One of my vassals is reminding me of the promise I made to destroy one of the local tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10118;Some promises are meant to be broken.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10118;We will eradicate them. Eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10118;Sigh. Hire more mercs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#ambush
EVTDESC_ZHE_10119;Ambush! Our enemies have banded together and our convoy is under attack. This skirmish will determine the fate of this expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10119;They have already lost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10119;Bow to the Zhentarim, you dogs!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZHE_10119;Fight on!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#succesful expedition
EVTDESC_ZHE_10125;We have crushed our pathetic opponents, and now the flag of the Black Network proudly flies over every caravan crossing our new route.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10125;It's just business.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#reward marshal?
EVTDESC_ZHE_10126;My marshal is eyeing my new wealth with poorly concealed interest. Should I share it?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10126;Well, it is fair.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZHE_10126;Ha! No way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
#failed expedition
EVTDESC_ZHE_10128;Our expeditionary force was forced to retreat. My plans have been foiled, for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZHE_10128;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;x
