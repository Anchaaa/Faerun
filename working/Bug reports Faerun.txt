MAJOR BUGS


NOTED BUGS AND ODDITIES


- Mercenary bands require locale.
- scarred trait causes horrible things to happen to Sun Elf faces and Moon Elves love looking undernourished.
- soft_death is still a thing that happens and that I will never get.
- baronies in d_sea_glades and d_the_stormstars (?) independent from lieges.
- Elves get events claiming suspicion of immortality.
- Focus-windows are heavily out of whack, showing the focus-text in places no sane person could read. (as in, in the middle of the screen.)
- Kingdom of Dalelands...SOMEHOW not formable as Cormanthor. (Cultural requirements not shown?)
- Cities held by feudal lords, making them MORE useless than before.
- duel engine lacks locale!
- item smithy-guy doesn't do anything, but appears anyway.
- Gate to Hell-event from Monks & Mystics still fires, seems weird in a place where it can legitimately BE a Gate to Hell. 

- Some giants do not show up, only their backgrounds do (appears to be females?)
- Targeted decisions to recruit for Satan/The cold Ones/Cult of Kari Pulushka etc. appear on right-clicking strangers.
- Fey'ri have little to no decisions available.
BR FIXED, IN THEORY, NEEDS TESTING- Monster regions that are culturally de-monsterified keep their monstrous modifiers. Marvelous.
	- Still applies to Fey'ri-cultured provinces, pending further testing. 

SUGGESTIONS AND WISHES

- Please make that STUPID-ASS Event where your Character drinks too much so a councillor gets a favour not make you 100% a drunkard if the asshole decides to leave you. 
	The trait is ridiculously bad, the event ridiculously common and nobody ever helps. 20-50% should suffice, dammit!
	
FIXED BUGS
BR FIXED-- Severe illness and other such modifiers are apparently not removed in some occasions. (seek healing seems weirdly arbitrary in that regard.)

EVILCAT FIXED - - Chosen of Mystra lacks gfx.
ZARA FIXED- The Emperor of Not-China-Anymore REALLY loves blocking your council and appears whenever someone dies. Removing him requires council-window-appointments. 
BR FIXED- Elves also should not get the "the old"-nickname. Best just ditch it, it's stupid anyway. 
BR FIXED- !!!!!CANNOT DECLARE WARS ANYMORE. OPTION NOT APPEARING!!!!! 
BR FIXED-- New CBs need to be blocked from monster hordes
BR FIXED- murder-plots unavailable.
TSF FIXED - - Monster mobs can still declare holy wars.
Unknowningly FIXED - Shilkushore (county in Chult- The Deepgreen duchy ) and Velsit (Chondalwood - Chondalwood) have pieces of land in the middle of the Pelvuria-Glacier.
BR FIXED, ALONG WITH OTHER INHERITANCE ISSUES - Children of Elves and Humans are not becoming half-elves
BR FIXED, CHANGE RESPAWN TIME FROM 2 YEARS TO 6000 DAYS- Monster mobs that are attacked keep spawning more event troops, up to ridiculous degrees.
BR FIXED- All monster hordes are yikarians
BR FIXED- Interbreeding needs serious rework again. Nobody ever gets the right trait (except ogre-ethnical half-ogres.)
BR FIXED, MONSTERS CAN NO LONGER HAVE CONCUBINES- Monster mobs concubine other monster mobs, making more monster mobs. maliciously.
